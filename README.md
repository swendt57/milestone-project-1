## Randy Bick Photography

This is a refactor of randybick.com which was designed for larger screens only. I have been friends with Randy for many 
years and have worked with him to create at least three major versions of his website with multiple tweaks along the way.

It was time for a responsive design and that is what I chose for my milestone project. You can see the existing site at 
www.randybick.com and this new version is temporarily deployed at www.randybick.com/new

The most difficult part was the overlay hover effect used on Corporate, Portraits, and Families. The solution requires fixed 
positioning which turned out to be quite challenging with a responsive design.

### UX
Since this is a redesign of an existing website, no user stories were created. The main purpose of this site is to provide
an easily accessible place for Randy to display samples of his work. 

I did create some mock-ups in Balsamiq Mockup 3 and these can be downloaded from my GitHub site.

### Features

**The site includes the following:**

* A **Home** page that displays a few of Randy's images and  has a photo gallery attached to it.
* An **About Randy** page that gives a brief highlight of Randy's accomplishments.
* A **Fine Art** gallery that displays some of Randy's more recent Cincinnati, Ohio and Covington, Kentucky "city scapes."
* A **Corporate Photography** page that shows examples of some of the corporate work Randy has done.
* A **Portraits** page that highlight two different possible photographic packages, a single collage or an album.
* A **Family Portraits** page that has galleries showing the albums for two different families.
* A **Contact Us** form that allows the user to submit questions to Randy.

**Possible future work:**

* Expand the Fine Art section with some other examples beyond city scapes.
* Add in pricing. He used to have very specific pricing, but removed it a while back. He may put some general pricing 
estimates back in at some point.
